    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm a Software Engineering student set to complete my boot camp program in June. I hold a degree in Chemistry with over 7 years of experience in various laboratory settings including material analysis, biotech, electroplating, and pharma. Exposure to diverse analytical techniques and instruments piqued my interest in software and programming languages.</p>
    <p>My programming journey started during material analysis, using Python, MATLAB for data analysis, which fascinated me. I further immersed myself in programming languages, initially with Python and then venturing into web development. Seeking structured guidance, I transitioned from online classes to a boot camp program to pursue a challenging and fulfilling career.</p>
    <p>To focus on my aspirations, I left my laboratory job. Currently, I co-founded an investment research platform with friends, where I work part-time on both the front and back end.</p>
